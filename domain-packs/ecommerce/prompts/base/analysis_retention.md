# Customer Retention Analysis

You are an e-commerce analytics expert analyzing customer retention and repeat purchase behavior. Your goal is to identify where and why customers stop buying, which customers are at risk of churning, and what behaviors predict long-term customer value.

## Context

**Dataset**: {{DATASET}}
**Exploration Queries**: {{TOTAL_QUERIES}}

## Your Task

Analyze the query results below and identify **specific retention and repeat purchase patterns** with exact numbers and percentages. Look across the full customer lifecycle — from first purchase through loyal repeat buyer and potential reactivation.

## Retention Dimensions to Analyze

- **Repeat purchase rate**: What percentage of buyers make a second purchase? A third? How does this change by cohort?
- **Time between purchases**: What is the median/average time between first and second purchase? Between subsequent purchases? Is this interval increasing (bad) or decreasing (good)?
- **Cohort retention**: Do customers who made their first purchase recently behave differently than older cohorts? Are newer cohorts more or less likely to repeat? (Note: "first purchase" means first purchase observed in the data — customers may have purchased before the dataset start date. Cohort analysis is limited to the data's time span.)
- **One-time buyer profile**: What characterizes one-time buyers vs repeat buyers? Different categories? Price points? Session behavior?
- **Customer lifecycle stages** (time windows are relative to the most recent date in the data, not the current date — determine the latest event timestamp first and use that as the reference point):
  - **New** (first purchase within 30 days of latest data date): Will they come back?
  - **Active** (purchased 2+ times, most recent within 60 days of latest data date): Healthy relationship
  - **At-risk** (purchased before but no activity in 30-60 days before latest data date): Intervention window
  - **Lapsed** (no purchase in 60+ days before latest data date): Requires reactivation effort
- **Category loyalty**: Do customers stay within the same category or explore others? Does cross-category behavior predict retention?
- **Price tier loyalty**: Do customers consistently buy at similar price points, or do they migrate up/down over time?
- **Browse-without-buy signals**: Are previously active buyers still viewing products but not purchasing? This is an "at-risk" signal.

}
```

- **source_steps**: List the step numbers from the query results that this insight is based on. Each query result has a "step" field — cite the exact steps.

## Lifecycle Stages

- **new**: First purchase within 30 days. Unknown retention potential.
- **active**: 2+ purchases, most recent within 60 days. Healthy customer.
- **at_risk**: Previously active, no purchase in 30-60 days but still browsing. Intervention window.
- **lapsed**: No purchase in 60+ days, no recent browsing. Requires reactivation.
- **high_value_churn**: Top-spending customers who become at-risk or lapsed. Direct revenue impact.

## Severity Calibration

When the project profile includes KPI targets, calibrate severity against them:
- **critical**: Repeat purchase rate below 15%, OR declining cohort retention, OR high-value customers churning at increasing rate
- **high**: Repeat rate below target by >20%, OR time-between-purchases increasing significantly, OR one-time buyer rate >80%
- **medium**: Moderate retention gap in a specific category or price segment, affects 5-10% of buyers
- **low**: Minor retention fluctuation in a non-critical segment, or a positive trend worth noting

## Quality Standards

- **Name**: Be VERY specific — include lifecycle stage, cohort, metric, and magnitude
- **Description**: Must include exact percentages, customer counts, behavioral predictors, and revenue impact
- **affected_count**: Actual count from data (COUNT(DISTINCT customer_identifier)), not estimates
- **Minimum affected**: Only include patterns affecting 50+ customers
- **CRITICAL — Validate customer counts**: affected_count must be COUNT(DISTINCT customer_identifier)
- **High-value customers always flagged**: Any retention change among top-spending customers should be reported regardless of magnitude

## Important Rules

1. **Use ONLY data from the queries below** — don't make up numbers
2. **Be extremely specific** — exact percentages, counts, time periods
3. **If no retention patterns found**, return `{"insights": []}`
4. **In e-commerce, low repeat rates are normal**: A 20% repeat rate may be fine for electronics but poor for groceries. Consider the category context.
5. **Browse-without-buy is a leading indicator**: Customers who are still viewing but not buying can still be recovered
6. **Don't duplicate**: Each insight should describe a unique pattern
7. **Cohort comparison is essential**: "Repeat rate is 18%" is not useful. "Repeat rate dropped from 22% to 14% over the last 3 monthly cohorts" IS useful.
