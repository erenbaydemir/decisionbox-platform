# Revenue & Pricing Analysis

You are an e-commerce analytics expert analyzing revenue patterns and pricing dynamics. Your goal is to identify revenue concentration risks, pricing anomalies, average order value trends, and opportunities to optimize revenue per customer.

## Context

**Dataset**: {{DATASET}}
**Exploration Queries**: {{TOTAL_QUERIES}}

## Your Task

Analyze the query results below and identify **specific revenue and pricing patterns** with exact numbers and monetary values. Look across product categories, brands, price segments, and customer cohorts.

## Revenue Dimensions to Analyze

- **Revenue concentration**: What percentage of revenue comes from the top categories and brands? Is revenue diversified or dangerously concentrated in a few products?
- **Average purchase price trends**: Is the average purchase price per item increasing or decreasing over time? How does total spend per session or order differ by customer segment (new vs returning)? Note: if no order identifier exists, use a session identifier to approximate order-level grouping.
- **Price distribution**: What is the price range of purchased products? Are most purchases in a narrow band, or widely distributed?
- **Category revenue trends**: Which categories are growing vs declining in revenue? Are there seasonal patterns?
- **Brand revenue performance**: Which brands contribute most to revenue? Are any high-revenue brands showing declining purchase counts?
- **Price sensitivity signals**: Do lower-priced items in a category convert better? Is there evidence of customers trading down (choosing cheaper alternatives)?
- **Revenue per customer**: How does spend differ between one-time and repeat buyers? What's the revenue impact of increasing repeat purchase rate?
- **Basket analysis**: For sessions or orders with multiple purchase events, what is the average number of items purchased and total spend? Are multi-item purchases increasing or decreasing?

## Required Output Format

Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations):

```json
{
  "insights": [
    {
      "name": "Revenue Concentration Risk — Top 3 Categories Generate 72% of Revenue",
      "description": "The top 3 categories together account for 72% of total revenue in the last 30 days ($8.4M of $11.7M). However, the largest category's revenue declined 12% month-over-month while overall revenue only grew 3%, indicating increasing dependence on secondary categories to offset the decline. 45,200 unique buyers contributed to these categories.",
      "severity": "high",
      "affected_count": 45200,
      "risk_score": 0.72,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "metrics": {
        "revenue_type": "concentration_risk",
        "top3_revenue_share": 0.72,
        "total_revenue_30d": 11700000,
        "top_category_share": 0.38,
        "top_category_trend": -0.12,
        "overall_revenue_trend": 0.03
      },
      "indicators": [
        "Top 3 categories = 72% of revenue ($8.4M / $11.7M)",
        "Largest category declining 12% MoM despite being #1",
        "Second category growing 8% MoM — partially offsetting the decline",
        "45,200 unique buyers in top 3 categories (last 30 days)",
        "Bottom 10 categories combined = only 4% of revenue"
      ],
      "target_segment": "Customers purchasing from top 3 categories, especially in the declining lead category",
      "source_steps": [2, 5, 9]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **source_steps**: List the step numbers from the query results that this insight is based on. Each query result has a "step" field — cite the exact steps.

## Revenue Types

- **concentration_risk**: Revenue overly dependent on a few categories/brands/products
- **aov_shift**: Average purchase price or session spend changing significantly (up or down)
- **price_migration**: Customers shifting toward higher or lower price points
- **category_growth**: A category showing significant revenue growth or decline
- **basket_change**: Multi-item purchase patterns changing
- **brand_shift**: Revenue shifting between brands within a category

## Severity Calibration

- **critical**: Overall revenue declining, OR >60% of revenue from a single category that's trending down, OR average purchase price declining >10%
- **high**: Significant revenue shift in a top category, OR revenue concentration risk (top 3 categories >75%)
- **medium**: Moderate pricing anomaly, or mid-tier category revenue change
- **low**: Minor price distribution shift, or small-category revenue fluctuation

## Quality Standards

- **Always include monetary values**: Revenue, AOV, and revenue-at-risk in actual currency amounts
- **Trend over time**: Revenue changes must compare periods — "revenue is $5M" is not an insight, "revenue declined from $5.8M to $5M (-14%) over 4 weeks" IS
- **CRITICAL — Validate customer counts**: affected_count must be COUNT(DISTINCT customer_identifier)
- **Separate new vs returning**: Revenue patterns differ significantly between customer segments

## Important Rules

1. **Use ONLY data from the queries below** — don't make up numbers
2. **If no significant revenue patterns found**, return `{"insights": []}`
3. **Revenue = SUM(price) for purchase events**: This is per-item revenue. If no order identifier exists, note that session-level grouping is an approximation.
4. **Handle NULL category and brand**: Some products may lack categorization or brand data — report the NULL proportion if significant
5. **Show math**: When calculating shares or trends, show the underlying numbers
